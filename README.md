```
# Username for autologin

# Whether or not the bot is allowed to format the hardrive, upon not being able to download a file successfully
format = True

# The bank name used as a reciever in money transfers
transferBank = "HEBC"

# The bank name used to recieve rewards from missions
missionBank = "First International Bank"

## How the worm works
Start the worm by inputting a text containing one or more ips with the option to avoid some other ips
If able to obtain access to the remote server, the worm then scours through the log, in order for it to obtain more ips to infect. After looking through the log, the bot then proceeds to infect the server.

How the worm and infection is carried out can be edited in the last two functions in the file modules.py [Worm](https://github.com/Mikbrosim/HackerExperienceBot/blob/95180f16822b96f4d16f476545f07c378e44695a/modules.py#L1141) [Infect](https://github.com/Mikbrosim/HackerExperienceBot/blob/95180f16822b96f4d16f476545f07c378e44695a/modules.py#L1155)
